Problem

A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring
of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring 
is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer 
common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT"
and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case,
"CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique;
for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest
common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of
length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common substring of the collection. 
(If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
