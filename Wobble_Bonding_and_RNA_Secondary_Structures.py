Problem

Given an RNA string s, we will augment the bonding graph of s

by adding basepair edges connecting all occurrences of 'U' to all occurrences of 'G' in order to represent
possible wobble base pairs.

We say that a matching in the bonding graph for s
is valid if it is noncrossing (to prevent pseudoknots) and has the property that a basepair edge in the matching cannot connect symbols sj 
and sk unless kâ‰¥j+4 (to prevent nearby nucleotides from base pairing).

See Figure 1 for an example of a valid matching if we allow wobble base pairs. In this problem, we will wish to 
count all possible valid matchings in a given bonding graph; see Figure 2 for all possible valid matchings in 
a small bonding graph, assuming that we allow wobble base pairing.

Given: An RNA string s(of length at most 200 bp).

Return: The total number of distinct valid matchings of basepair edges in the bonding
graph of s. Assume that wobble base pairing is allowed.
